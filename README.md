 Voice-Controlled-Wheelchair-for-Physically-Disabled-Person
 This project focuses on designing and implementing a wheel chair, which is a mechanically operated device that allows the user to move about independently. This minimizes the user's personal effort and the force required to move the wheelchair wheels. Furthermore, it allows visually or physically handicapped people to go from one location to another. Voice commands and button controls can be used to operate wheelchairs. In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in smart wheelchairs. These gadgets are very handy while traveling from one location to another. The devices can also be utilized in nursing homes where the elderly have difficulties moving about. For individuals who have lost their mobility, gadgets are a godsend. Different types of smart wheelchairs have been created in the past, but new generations of wheelchairs are being developed and utilized that incorporate the use of artificial intelligence and therefore leave the user with a little to tamper with. The project also intends to develop a comparable wheelchair that has some intelligence and assists the user in his or her mobility.
